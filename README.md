# Byzantine Fault-Tolerant Replicated State Machine Library

**Note:** This is still a work in progress (WIP).

This is a Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) state machine replication (SMR) library. 
It is an open source library written in Go.
The implementation is inspired by the [BFT-SMaRt project](https://github.com/bft-smart/library). 
For more information on this library see our [wiki page](https://github.com/SmartBFT-Go/consensus/wiki).
